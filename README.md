> Nix Package Tool

A (humble) successor to linux's `apt`, which makes life easier when using [nix](https://nixos.org/) as a package manager.

This is a tool I'm using in my nix journey, it's supposed to ease the transition from other
package managers to nix.

The idea is to use [nix profiles](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/package-management/profiles.html) in the way you'd use `apt` or `brew`.

It is a work in progress, but feel free to play with it.

## Requirements

- Install [nix the package manager](https://nixos.org/download.html)
- [Enable flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes)


## Goals

- Make it easy to transition from traditional package managers (`apt`, `brew`, `pacman`, etc)
- Good and ituitive UX
- Learn nix while using, this can display the commands executed (wip)

## Installation

```sh
nix profile install 'github:woile/npt#npt'
```

## Usage

```$ npt --help
Nix Package Tool
