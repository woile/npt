> Nix Package Tool

A (humble) successor to linux's `apt`, which makes life easier when using [nix](https://nixos.org/) as a package manager.

This is a tool I'm using in my nix journey, it's supposed to make the transition from other
package managers to nix.

It is not production ready, but you can play with it.

## Requirements

Make sure you have installed [nix the package manager](https://nixos.org/download.html).

## Goals

- Make it easy to transition from traditional package managers (`apt`, `brew`, `pacman`, etc)
- Good and ituitive UX
- Learn nix while using, this can display the commands executed.

## Installation

```sh
nix profile install github:woile/npt
```

## Usage

```$ npt --help
